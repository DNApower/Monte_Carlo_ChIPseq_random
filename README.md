# Monte Carlo estimate overlap in ChIP-seq
This file is used to estimate the probability of detecting overlapped signal in two biological repeated ChIP-seq experiments.

## Usage
input num_iterations, genome_size, peak_size, num_peaks
d = monte_carlo_seq(num_iterations,genome_size,peak_size,num_peaks)

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2 
Jupyter notebook
Numpy 1.12.1
